              Founded in 2010, OrganoSilvia was born from a passion for exceptional coffee and sustainable farming practices. Our journey began when Silvia Moretti, a third-generation coffee farmer, decided to share her family's carefully cultivated organic coffee with the world.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph text-coffee-medium mb-6">
              We work directly with small-scale organic coffee farmers in the most pristine growing regions, ensuring fair compensation and sustainable practices. Every bean is hand-selected, expertly roasted, and delivered fresh to provide you with the purest coffee experience.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph text-coffee-medium mb-8">
              Our signature Silvia Sparkle blend embodies our commitment to quality, sustainability, and the perfect cup of coffee. When you choose OrganoSilvia, you're not just enjoying premium coffee â€“ you're supporting a vision of environmental responsibility and community development.
